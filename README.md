# Task 6 – Time Series Forecasting & Heart Disease Prediction

## 1. Time Series Analysis – Sales Forecasting with ARIMA
- Analyze sales data over time
- Visualize trends and moving averages
- Train an ARIMA model to forecast future sales
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE & MAPE
- Save forecasts and plots

## 2. Heart Disease Prediction – Logistic Regression
- Predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient features
- Features: Age, Gender, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure
- Train a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluate performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Save predictions and evaluation report

---

## ⚙️ Installation
Install required libraries:
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn joblib

---

## ▶️ Usage
- If sales.csv or heart_disease.csv are missing, dummy datasets will be created automatically.
- Outputs (forecasts, metrics, and reports) will be saved in the project_outputs/ folder.
- Plots will open in a pop-up window.
